The semester will be end soon, it is sad as I like this course OOP. It gives me the best learning experience between the other 4 courses this semester. You are a really good teacher, I can feel your passion for teaching through the lecture, and also you are the only instructor I met wanna have interaction with your students. You always ask us to turn on our microphone, however, due to my poor English and pronunciation, sometimes I am too shy to speak in public, I need to overcome this situation.

For the final project, it was interesting, the content for our project is related to the news that happens in the real world. I believe for the last half-year, COVID-19 is the most popular topic in everyone's life. For me, writing a code based on the introduction is not hard any more but remember which function or operator has been overloaded and use it properly in the program is very challenging. For ms5, I already forget what I have in different modules, so it took me a long time to read and refresh myself about each module, then I can use the functions in the final milestone.

Thank you for being a great teacher in my study life, and I hope I will have more courses in which you are the instructor.
